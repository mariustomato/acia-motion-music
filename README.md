# acia-motion-music
This idea of the project is to use a xbox-kinetic camera to track a humans movement. The tracked movement data will then be analyzed by a trained ai to find data like mood of the person, what genre he/she/it prefers, ... . So in simple words: we try to make music using only motion.
